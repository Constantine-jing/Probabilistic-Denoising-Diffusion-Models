    "# Homework: Diffusion Models — Exploring the Cosine Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "**Based on:** DDPM Tutorial\n",
    "**References:** Ho et al. (2020); Nichol & Dhariwal (2021)  \n",
    "**Estimated time:** 20–30 minutes  \n",
    "\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tutorial you trained a DDPM on the **S-Curve** dataset using a **linear** noise schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nichol & Dhariwal (2021) showed that a **cosine schedule** preserves signal more evenly across timesteps, which can improve sample quality — especially for low-resolution data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "**Train the same DDPM architecture on the `make_moons` dataset using a cosine noise schedule**, then compare results to the linear schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate the Moons dataset** using `sklearn.datasets.make_moons` (2D, ~10,000 points, normalized)\n",
    "2. **Implement the cosine schedule** for $\\bar{\\alpha}_t$ as defined in Nichol & Dhariwal (2021)\n",
    "3. **Train the same `SimpleNoisePredictor`** model on this data with the cosine schedule  \n",
    "4. **Sample and visualize** generated points vs real data\n",
    "5. **Compare:** Also train with the linear schedule and show both results side by side\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hint Before You Start\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most of the code you need is already in the tutorial!** This homework is designed as a small tweak — not a rewrite. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model class (`SinusoidalEmbedding`, `SimpleNoisePredictor`), `q_sample`, and `sample_ddpm` can all be **copied directly** from the tutorial with no changes.\n",
    "- The training loop is also the same — just swap the dataset and schedule.\n",
    "- The only truly new code you need to write is the **cosine schedule** (Task 2) and deriving `betas` from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: open the tutorial side by side, reuse what you need, and focus your energy on understanding the cosine schedule and comparing results."
